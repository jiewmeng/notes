\section{Overheads}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Cost of starting thread/process
	\item Communication
	\item Syncronization
\end{itemize*}

In general, need for \hl{large granularity} (units of works) to run fast (\hl{less overheads}), but not so much there is too little parallel work

\subsection{Communication}

Tasks interact by sending messages through channels. 

Channels are message queues connecting a task's output to another task's input

\section{Foster's Design Methodology}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item \textbf{Partitioning}: tasks
	\item \textbf{Communication}: provide data to tasks
	\item \textbf{Agglomeration}: Reduce communications
	\item \textbf{Mapping}: Map tasks to processors. Goal: minimize total time
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Partitioning}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item \textbf{Data}: divide data into pieces of approx. same size. Then determine how to associate tasks to data
	\item \textbf{Functional}: Divide computation into pieces. Determine how to associate data with these computations. 
\end{itemize*}

\subsubsection{Goals}

\begin{tabular}{p{6cm} | p{6cm}}

At least 10x primitive tasks & Ensure sufficient parallelism later \\ 
\hline

Minimize redundent computations and data & Complicates things as problem size increases \\ 
\hline

Primitive tasks roughly same size & Load balancing \\ 
\hline

Tasks should increase as problem size increases & ensure scalability
\end{tabular}

\section{Communication}

In general, communication required to pass data between tasks

\begin{itemize*}
	\item \textbf{Local}: Small amounts of data from neighbours 
	\item \textbf{Global}: Significant number of tasks contribute data to perform computation
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Communication balanced between tasks (tree-like ($O(\log{n})$))
	\item Task communicate with small number of neighbours
	\item Overlap communication
	\item Overlap computation
\end{itemize*}

\section{Agglomeration}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Combine tasks into larger tasks (reduce communication)
	\item Improve performance
	\item Maintain scalability
	\item Simplify programming
	\item 1 agglomerated task per processor
\end{itemize*}

\subsection{Goals}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Locality increased
	\item Number of tasks increase with task size
\end{itemize*}


\section{Mapping}

\begin{itemize*}
	\item Assign task to processor
	\item Maximize pricessor utilization (tasks on different prorcessors)
	\item Minimize inter processor communication (assign tasks that communicate frequently to same processor)
\end{itemize*}
