# Chemistry of Life

## Organic Compounds

- Carbon linked to $>= 1$ Hydrogen atom
- Each Carbon atom
    - Can bond with $<= 4$ atoms
    - Linked by single/double/triple bonds
- Chains/Rings

## Functional Groups

- Atoms/small groups of atoms bonded to carbon backbone
- Different chemical properties to organic compounds

## Synthesis/Breakdown

### Macromolecules

- Large organic compounds
- Many monomers (repeating units)
- Joined thru. **dehydration**/condensation/dehydration synthesis
- Broken through **hydrolysis**

### Dehydration (Synthesis/joining monomers)

- 1 $H$ and $OH$ loss ($H_2 O$)
- $(H - Monomer - OH) + (H - Monomer - OH) \Rightarrow (H - Monomer - Monomer - OH) + H_2 O$

### Hydrolysis (Breakdown/split monomer with water)

- Water broken with $H_2 O$
- $(H - Monomer - Monomer - OH) + H_2 O \Rightarrow (H - Monomer - OH) + (H - Monomer - OH)$

## Carbohydrates

- Important energy source
- Many polar hydroxyl (OH) groups
    - Mostly water-soluble (hydrophilic)
- Subunit - monosacchariade (simple sugar)
- Linked by condensation
    - 2 sugars - disaccharide
    - Several sugars - oligosaccharide
    - Many sugars - polysaccharide

### Monosaccharides

- $(C H_2 O)_n$ (eg. $C_6 H_{12} O_6$)
- Most have 5 (pentose) or 6 (hexoses) carbon backbone
- Simple sugar molecule
    - Glucose
    - Ribose
    - Deoxyribose

### Oligosaccharides

- Several monosaccharides linked via condensation
- Sometimes linked with other biological molecules
    - Proteins - glycoproteins
    - Lipids - Glycolipids
    - Exterior surface of cells
    - Maybe used as labels for cell type identification

### Disaccharides (a type of Oligosaccharide)

- 2 Covalently bonded monosaccharide
- Sucrose - Glucose + Fructose
- Lactose - Glucose + Galactose
- Maltose - 2 x Glucose

### Polysaccharides

- Many monosaccharides linked to form chains
    - Straight/Branched
    - Mostly composed entirely of glucose
- Storage
    - Starch (Plants)
    - Glycogen (Animals)
- Structure
    - Cellulose
    - Chitin

#### Starch

- Polymer of glucose
- Formed in roots/seeds
- Amylose: unbranched
- Amylopectin: branched

#### Glycogen

- Polymer of glucose
- Found in liver/muscles
- More extensively branched than amylopectin

#### Cellulose

- Polymer of glucose
- Cell walls of plants
    - Structural support
    - Main component of wood/natural fibers
- Connected differently from starch ($O$ alternating between top/down), thus indigestable by most animals

#### Chitin

- Polymer of modified glucose

## Proteins
